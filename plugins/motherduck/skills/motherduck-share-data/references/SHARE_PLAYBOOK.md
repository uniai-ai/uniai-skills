## What Shares Are

A share is a read-only reference to a MotherDuck database. When you create a share, MotherDuck records share metadata pointing at the source database. No bytes are copied. Recipients attach the share and query it as a read-only clone in their own workspace.

Key properties:

- **Read-only**: recipients can `SELECT`, but never `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`
- **Zero-copy**: no data duplication; the share itself incurs no additional storage cost
- **Database-granularity**: shares are created from databases, not arbitrary subsets of tables
- **Owner-controlled updates**: use `UPDATE MANUAL` for explicit snapshots or `UPDATE AUTOMATIC` for periodic propagation
- **Access-controlled**: restrict who can attach the share by organization, ACL, or share URL pattern

## SQL-First Posture

- Keep share creation and maintenance as explicit SQL, even when the caller is an application or provisioning tool.
- Make access, visibility, and update mode explicit in every `CREATE SHARE`.
- Treat share operations as auditable database changes, not as hidden driver logic.
- Use SQL to verify the share state after every create, update, grant, revoke, or attach step.

## Default Workflow

1. Choose the source database to share.
2. Decide access level, visibility, and freshness requirements.
3. Create the share with explicit options.
4. Distribute the share URL if the share is hidden or external.
5. Have recipients attach and query the data.
6. For manual shares, run `UPDATE SHARE` on the owner side and `REFRESH DATABASE` on the consumer side.

## SQL Workflow Template

Use this sequence as the default shape:

```sql
-- owner side
CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS partner_share FROM analytics (
  ACCESS RESTRICTED,
  VISIBILITY HIDDEN,
  UPDATE MANUAL
);

GRANT READ ON SHARE partner_share TO duck1, duck2;

LIST SHARES;
FROM MD_INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OWNED_SHARES;

-- later, when publishing a new manual snapshot
UPDATE SHARE partner_share;

-- consumer side
ATTACH '<share_url>' AS partner_data;
REFRESH DATABASE partner_data;

SELECT * FROM "partner_data"."main"."customers" LIMIT 10;
```

## Create a Share

```sql
CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS my_data_share FROM my_database (
  ACCESS ORGANIZATION,
  VISIBILITY DISCOVERABLE,
  UPDATE AUTOMATIC
);
```

This creates a share named `my_data_share` from `my_database` that anyone in your organization can discover and attach, and that updates automatically — the default posture for internal sharing. Always state access, visibility, and update mode explicitly.

## Access Levels

Choose the access level that matches your distribution model. Default to the most restrictive level that meets your needs.

| Level | Who Can Access | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| ORGANIZATION | Anyone in your MotherDuck organization | Internal team sharing |
| RESTRICTED | Specific users you grant access to | Named-recipient sharing and internal ACLs |
| UNRESTRICTED | Anyone with the share URL | Public datasets |

Use `ORGANIZATION` for internal sharing. It requires no per-user grants and automatically covers new team members.

Use `RESTRICTED` for named users when you need an ACL instead of broad organization access. Grant access with `GRANT READ ON SHARE ... TO ...`.

Use `UNRESTRICTED` only for truly public or deliberate link-based distribution. Never use it for sensitive, proprietary, or PII-containing data.

## Visibility Options

Visibility controls whether the share is easy for users to find. Access level still controls who can read it.

| Visibility | Behavior |
|---|---|
| DISCOVERABLE | Appears in the UI and other discovery surfaces for users who have access |
| HIDDEN | Only accessible via direct URL |

Use `DISCOVERABLE` by default. It reduces "I didn't know that data existed" problems.

Use `HIDDEN` when the share contains sensitive data or when you want to control distribution strictly through direct URL sharing.

## Update Modes

Update mode determines whether the share reflects a frozen snapshot or always-current data.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| MANUAL | Share reflects the last explicit published snapshot; run `UPDATE SHARE` to refresh |
| AUTOMATIC | Share updates automatically after source database changes propagate |

Use `MANUAL` for point-in-time snapshots, versioned data products, and reproducible analysis.

Use `AUTOMATIC` for always-current data. Treat it as periodic propagation rather than instant synchronization.

## Common Share Patterns

### Internal Team Share

```sql
CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS analytics_share FROM analytics_db (
  ACCESS ORGANIZATION,
  VISIBILITY DISCOVERABLE,
  UPDATE AUTOMATIC
);
```

### Named-Recipient Share

```sql
CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS partner_results FROM partner_deliverables (
  ACCESS RESTRICTED,
  VISIBILITY HIDDEN,
  UPDATE MANUAL
);
```

Grant access explicitly:

```sql
GRANT READ ON SHARE partner_results TO duck1, duck2;
```

### Link-Based External Share

```sql
CREATE SHARE IF NOT EXISTS partner_benchmark FROM benchmark_data (
  ACCESS UNRESTRICTED,
  VISIBILITY HIDDEN,
  UPDATE MANUAL
);
```

## Operating Shares

### List All Shares You Own

```sql
LIST SHARES;
```

```sql
FROM MD_INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OWNED_SHARES;
```

`LIST SHARES` lists shares created by the current user. For shares from other users, use `MD_INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_WITH_ME` (see Consuming Shares).

### Manually Refresh a Share

Use this when the share has `UPDATE MANUAL` and the source data has changed.

```sql
UPDATE SHARE my_data_share;
```

After refreshing, tell recipients to run `REFRESH DATABASE` on their attached clone if they need the new snapshot immediately.

### Modify Recipient Access

For restricted shares, grant or revoke access explicitly:

```sql
GRANT READ ON SHARE my_data_share TO user_1, user_2;
REVOKE READ ON SHARE my_data_share FROM user_3;
```

### Delete a Share

Remove a share permanently. Recipients lose access immediately.

```sql
DROP SHARE my_data_share;
```

Dropping a share does not affect the source database. It only removes the share reference.

## Consuming Shares

### Attach a Shared Database

```sql
ATTACH '<share_url>' AS partner_data;
```

Replace `<share_url>` with the URL provided by the share owner. Choose a meaningful alias that describes the data.

### Refresh to Get Latest Updates

When the share owner updates a manual share, refresh to pull the latest snapshot:

```sql
REFRESH DATABASE partner_data;
```

### Query Shared Data

Once attached, query shared tables like any other database. Use fully qualified names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM "partner_data"."main"."customers" LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    o.order_total
FROM "partner_data"."main"."customers" c
JOIN "my_db"."main"."orders" o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### See What Is Shared With You

```sql
FROM MD_INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_WITH_ME;
```

This returns share names, URLs, owners, and metadata. Use the URL to attach shares you have not yet attached.

## Discovering and Exploring Shares

### Find Shares by URL

```sql
FROM MD_INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_WITH_ME
WHERE url = '<share_url>';
```

### Explore a Shared Database After Attaching

Once a share is attached, explore it like any other database:

```sql
SELECT database_name, schema_name, table_name, comment
FROM duckdb_tables()
WHERE database_name = 'partner_data';
```

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, comment
FROM duckdb_columns()
WHERE database_name = 'partner_data'
  AND table_name = 'customers';
```

```sql
SUMMARIZE "partner_data"."main"."customers";
```

## Use Cases

- **Cross-team analytics**: share curated datasets between data engineering, analytics, and product teams. Use `ORGANIZATION` access with `AUTOMATIC` updates so everyone sees current data.
- **Partner data exchange**: share results with named users via `RESTRICTED` access and `GRANT READ ON SHARE`, or use a hidden URL when distribution is link-based. Use `MANUAL` updates to control exactly what version partners see.
- **Public datasets**: make open data available to anyone with `UNRESTRICTED` access. Treat link distribution deliberately and do not use it for sensitive datasets.
- **Data products**: build curated, versioned datasets for consumption. Use `MANUAL` updates to create explicit versions and refresh on a defined cadence.
- **Reproducible analysis**: share a frozen snapshot of the data used in a specific analysis. Use `MANUAL` updates and `HIDDEN` visibility.

## Key Rules

- Shares are read-only.
- Zero-copy means no storage duplication for the share itself.
- Use `MANUAL` update mode for snapshots and `AUTOMATIC` for always-current delivery.
- Use `ORGANIZATION` for internal sharing unless there is a clear reason not to.
- Use `RESTRICTED` for named recipients and ACL-style control.
- Use `DISCOVERABLE` by default and `HIDDEN` when distribution should stay controlled.
- Notify recipients after `UPDATE SHARE` on manual shares because they may need `REFRESH DATABASE`.
- Use fully qualified table names when querying shared databases.
- Use shares for governed distribution, not writable collaboration.

## Common Mistakes

### Expecting Recipients to Write to Shared Databases

Shares are read-only. If a recipient needs to modify or extend shared data, they should copy it into their own database first:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "my_db"."main"."local_copy" AS
SELECT * FROM "partner_data"."main"."customers";
```

### Using Unrestricted Access for Sensitive Data

`UNRESTRICTED` means anyone with the URL can access the data. Never use this for proprietary, internal, or PII-containing datasets.

### Treating Shares Like Row-Level Security

Shares operate at database level. If you need per-customer or per-user isolation, publish separate databases or move to customer-facing analytics patterns with stronger structural isolation.

### Forgetting to Update a Manual Share

With `MANUAL` update mode, recipients see stale data until you explicitly refresh:

```sql
UPDATE SHARE my_data_share;
```

### Forgetting to Refresh on the Consumer Side

Even after the owner updates the share, recipients must refresh their attached copy:

```sql
REFRESH DATABASE partner_data;
```

### Dropping a Share Without Notifying Recipients

When you drop a share, recipients lose access immediately. Communicate a deprecation window before removing a share that other people rely on.

### Not Exploring Shared Data Before Querying

Always inspect the shared schema before writing downstream queries:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM duckdb_tables()
WHERE database_name = 'partner_data';
```

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM duckdb_columns()
WHERE database_name = 'partner_data'
  AND table_name = 'customers';
```
