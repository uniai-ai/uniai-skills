# Partner Delivery

Use this skill when a consultancy, implementation partner, or multi-client product team is delivering MotherDuck solutions repeatedly across customer accounts. Partners often work across different industries — retail, healthcare, fintech, logistics — so client data models and schemas will differ by industry. What stays consistent is the architecture: isolation, provisioning, connection patterns, and deployment structure. This skill focuses on the repeatable infrastructure layer, not the client-specific data model.

- Public product anchors (Hypertenancy, read scaling, Dives, shares)
- Default multi-client pattern

- Shares vs Dives vs full apps
- Region and compliance handling

## Source Of Truth

- Prefer current MotherDuck public docs and product pages.
- If the MotherDuck MCP `ask_docs_question` feature is available, use it first.
- Verify anything commercial, regional, or security-sensitive against live public materials before giving a definitive answer.

## Verified Delivery Defaults

Defaults that hold across partner deliveries:

- standardize the isolation and provisioning pattern, not the client schema
- keep one database namespace and one credential boundary per client unless the customer has a stronger requirement
- make region choice explicit in the delivery contract
- treat client-specific ingestion or app code as add-ons around the core multi-client isolation model

## Validation Signals

Use these signals for testing, review, and regression checks. They are not an instruction to include a separate "Validation Signals" section in normal user-facing replies.

- run `artifacts/client_delivery_example.py` against temporary MotherDuck databases
- verify each client gets its own database entry in the output payload
- verify the delivery pattern still states one database and one credential boundary per client
- treat any partner template that assumes a shared client schema as a regression

## Language Focus: TypeScript/Javascript and Python

- Prefer **TypeScript/Javascript** for reusable partner delivery assets in:
  - product backends
  - starter APIs
  - admin or client provisioning tools
- Prefer **Python** for:
  - implementation scripts
  - migration helpers
  - validation tooling
  - operational handoff assets
- When producing a partner-ready solution, it is often best to provide:
  - a TypeScript/Javascript app skeleton
  - Python validation or migration helpers

## TypeScript/Javascript Starter

```ts
type ClientConfig = {
  slug: string;
  database: string;
  region: "us-east-1" | "eu-central-1";
  serviceAccountEnvVar: string;
};

const clients: ClientConfig[] = [
  { slug: "acme", database: "customer_acme", region: "us-east-1", serviceAccountEnvVar: "ACME_MD_TOKEN" },
];
```

## Python Provisioning and Validation Starter

```python
import duckdb

PARTNER_USER_AGENT = "agent-skills/2.2.2(harness-<harness>;llm-<llm>)"


def provision_client(conn: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection, slug: str, region: str) -> dict:
    """Provision a new client database with the standard schema."""
    db_name = f"customer_{slug}"
    conn.execute(f"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS {db_name}")
    conn.execute(f"""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "{db_name}"."main"."usage_daily" (
            usage_date DATE NOT NULL,
            metric_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
            metric_value DOUBLE NOT NULL,
            updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp
        )
    """)
    conn.execute(f"""
        COMMENT ON TABLE "{db_name}"."main"."usage_daily"
        IS 'Daily usage metrics for client {slug}'
    """)
    return {"slug": slug, "database": db_name, "region": region}


def validate_client_database(conn: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection, database_name: str) -> dict:
    """Validate that a client database has the expected tables and row counts."""
    tables = conn.sql(f"""
        SELECT table_name, estimated_size
        FROM duckdb_tables()
        WHERE database_name = '{database_name}'
    """).fetchall()
    return {
        "database": database_name,
        "table_count": len(tables),
        "tables": [{"name": t[0], "estimated_size": t[1]} for t in tables],
        "pass": len(tables) > 0,
    }


def validate_all_clients(clients: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Run validation across all client databases and report results."""
    conn = duckdb.connect(f"md:?custom_user_agent={PARTNER_USER_AGENT}")
    results = []
    for client in clients:
        result = validate_client_database(conn, client["database"])
        result["slug"] = client["slug"]
        results.append(result)
    conn.close()
    return results
```

## Delivery Principles

- Prefer structural isolation over query-time tenant filtering for serious client work.
- Standardize the architecture, not the client data itself.
- Keep credentials and sharing boundaries explicit per client.
- Use a small set of approved deployment patterns rather than inventing a new one per engagement.

## Public Product Anchors To Use

- Hypertenancy is the public MotherDuck pattern for dedicated compute per user or customer.
- MotherDuck documents service-account-driven provisioning and per-customer or per-workload isolation patterns for Hypertenancy-style applications.
- Read scaling is the public pattern for read-heavy BI and app workloads.
- Dives are shareable live workspace artifacts, and Embedded Dives can serve app surfaces when the client needs a read-only live dashboard inside an existing product. Keep implementation mechanics in `motherduck-create-dive` and REST endpoint details in `motherduck-rest-api`.
- DuckLake sharing is currently documented as read-only via shares in current DuckLake guidance.
- Shares are zero-copy and database-granularity, so partner delivery should publish curated database boundaries rather than exposing internal staging layouts.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Classify the client pattern:
   - internal analytics enablement
   - customer-facing analytics
   - pipeline and reporting
   - regional or residency-constrained deployment
2. Pick the default architecture.
3. Standardize provisioning and deployment checklists.
4. Design the industry-specific data model, schema, and output assets for their use case.

## Default Multi-Client Pattern

Use this as the default unless the client requirements force a deviation:

- one service account per client
- or one service account per workload boundary when the client has multiple blast-radius tiers
- one database namespace per client or stronger isolation boundary
- shared deployment checklist and provisioning steps
- per-client tokens and access revocation path

For customer-facing analytics with stronger isolation and performance requirements:

- pair this skill with `motherduck-build-cfa-app`
- use Hypertenancy-style patterns
- add read scaling only when concurrency demands it

## What To Standardize

These are the architecture-level patterns that should be consistent across clients regardless of industry:

- connection pattern
- database provisioning and isolation model
- service account policy
- sharing model

Schemas, table structures, dashboard layouts, and Dive templates will vary by industry. Use `motherduck-model-data` to design the right schema for each client rather than forcing a single starter schema across all engagements.

## When To Use Shares vs Dives vs Full Apps

- Use shares when the client team wants direct access to query data in MotherDuck or downstream tools.
- Use Dives when the client wants a live, shareable visualization inside the MotherDuck workspace.
- Use a full customer-facing app pattern when the client needs embedded analytics, product UX control, or stricter tenant-facing experience guarantees.

## What To Keep Client-Specific

- schema design and table structure (driven by client industry and use case)
- source systems and ingestion sources
- business metrics
- data contracts
- residency constraints
- dashboard and Dive templates (tailored to the client's industry domain)
- end-user UX and rollout cadence

## Region And Compliance Handling

- Verify current region availability before committing to a design.
- Keep client object storage, external buckets, and regional service-account assumptions aligned with the target MotherDuck region whenever the delivery pattern controls those choices.
- Escalate trust/compliance questions to `motherduck-security-governance` patterns when they become first-order blockers.
- Treat residency, AWS PrivateLink, and formal compliance documents as plan-sensitive and current-state-sensitive topics that require live verification.

The output of this skill should be a repeatable delivery pattern plus the client-specific exceptions that still need attention.
