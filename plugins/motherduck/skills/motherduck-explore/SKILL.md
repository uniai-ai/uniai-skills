# Explore MotherDuck Data

Use this skill when you need to discover what databases, tables, and columns exist in a MotherDuck account; preview and sample data; understand schemas and data types; find shared databases; or search the data catalog.

## Prerequisites

- An established MotherDuck connection (or an active MotherDuck MCP server)

## Default Posture

- Explore top-down: databases, then tables/views, then columns, then statistics, then sample rows.
- Use fully qualified table names once more than one database is attached.
- Check shared databases before concluding that data is unavailable.
- Use the MotherDuck MCP tools (`list_databases`, `list_tables`, `list_columns`, `search_catalog`) when available because they return structured results faster than ad hoc SQL.
- Return a concise schema map with table grain, join keys, date columns, and likely measures before moving into modeling or dashboard work.

## Workflow

1. List databases in scope.
2. List tables and views in the target database.
3. Inspect columns, types, nullability, and comments before writing queries.
4. Run `SUMMARIZE` on important tables to understand ranges, cardinality, and null rates.
5. Preview rows, capture grain and join assumptions, and only then move into analytical SQL or modeling work.
