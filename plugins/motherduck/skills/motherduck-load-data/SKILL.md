description: Load and ingest data into MotherDuck from local files, object storage (S3, GCS, Azure, R2), HTTPS, dataframes, or external databases. Use for any import or bulk-load task — CSV, Parquet, JSON, Delta, Iceberg, local DuckDB database upload — and for choosing between CTAS, INSERT...SELECT, COPY, cloud-storage secrets, and Postgres-endpoint versus native DuckDB-client paths.

# Load Data into MotherDuck

Use this skill when the job is getting data into MotherDuck correctly and efficiently, not just writing one ad hoc import query.

## Source Of Truth

- Prefer current MotherDuck loading, cloud-storage, and Postgres-endpoint loading docs first.
- Use `CREATE SECRET` and cloud-storage docs for protected-object-store workflows.
- Use the DuckDB database upload docs when the source is an existing local `.duckdb`, `.ddb`, or attached DuckDB database.
- Keep the loading advice aligned with MotherDuck's documented posture:
  - batch over streaming
  - Parquet over CSV when you control the format
  - dataframe, `COPY`, CTAS, or `INSERT ... SELECT` over row-by-row inserts
  - native MotherDuck storage first unless DuckLake is explicitly required

## Default Posture

- Start by classifying the source: object storage or HTTPS, local file or local DuckDB, in-memory rows, or an external database.
- Prefer `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` for first loads and `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` for appends.
- For whole local DuckDB databases, use `CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE remote_name FROM CURRENT_DATABASE()`, an attached local database, or a file path from a native DuckDB client after attaching `md:`.
- Use Parquet for durable bulk movement whenever you control the source format.
- Treat the Postgres endpoint as a thin-client path for server-side remote reads, not for local-file or extension-driven ingestion.
- Bootstrap the target MotherDuck database first when the ingestion tool does not create it automatically.
- Keep raw landing minimally transformed; do typing, deduplication, and business logic in staging or modeling steps.
- Keep source storage close to the MotherDuck region when you control placement.

## Workflow

1. Identify where the source data actually lives.
2. Choose the loading path:
   - object storage or HTTPS: remote read into MotherDuck
   - local file or local DuckDB: use a DuckDB client path
   - in-memory rows: Arrow or dataframe bulk load first, batched inserts only as a fallback
   - external database: use the appropriate scan or replication path from a DuckDB-capable environment
3. Land the data into a raw or staging table with minimal transformation.
4. Validate row counts, types, and a few business aggregates immediately after the load.
5. Promote into modeled tables only after the landing step is correct.
