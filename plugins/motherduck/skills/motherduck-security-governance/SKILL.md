# Security and Governance

Use this skill when the user is evaluating whether MotherDuck can meet their security, governance, and deployment requirements. This is a workflow skill focused on control boundaries and safe patterns.

## Source Of Truth

- Prefer current MotherDuck public trust, security, pricing, and product documentation.
- If the MotherDuck MCP `ask_docs_question` feature is available, use it first.
- Use current SSO and data-recovery docs when the requirement involves identity-provider login, restore windows, named snapshots, or `UNDROP DATABASE`.
- Verify claims against live public materials before making compliance or commercial assertions.

## Default Posture

- Prefer service accounts for production systems, not personal tokens.
- Keep credentials in backend-controlled secrets, not browsers or hardcoded notebooks.
- Prefer structural isolation over query-time tenant filtering for serious B2B or CFA workloads.
- Treat region and residency as first-class architectural constraints that require current public confirmation.
- Be explicit about whether the boundary is a share, a Dive, a database, or a full application.
- Separate documented product guarantees from architectural recommendations and assumptions in the final answer.

## Workflow

1. Identify where credentials live and who administers them.
2. Define the actual isolation boundary: account, database, schema, or query filter.
3. Determine who can read, write, share, or administer the data.
4. Check whether residency, compliance, or contractual guarantees are part of the requirement.
5. Use only publicly documented security anchors unless the user has current commercial documentation in hand.
