# Enable Self-Serve Analytics

Use this skill when a team wants broad internal access to analytics without turning every question into a central data-team ticket. This is a use-case skill focused on governed rollout, not just chart creation.

## Contents

- Source of truth and verified delivery defaults
- Validation Signals (maintainer/reviewer checks)
- Language focus and starter snippets (TSX Dive view, Python dataset)
- Public product anchors (Dives, shares, read scaling)
- What to publish first and the recommended sequence (curate, publish, expand)
- Choosing between Dives and shares
- Scale guidance and what not to promise

## Source Of Truth

- Prefer MotherDuck public docs and product pages for Dives, sharing, pricing, and read scaling.
- If the MotherDuck MCP `ask_docs_question` feature is available, use it first.
- When it is unavailable, use the public Dives, pricing, and Hypertenancy pages plus the docs site.

## Verified Delivery Defaults

Defaults that hold across self-serve rollouts:

- pick one audience first instead of launching broadly
- publish one governed dataset before expanding the surface area
- make the first asset a MotherDuck-native answer surface such as a Dive
- keep ownership, sharing, and editing boundaries explicit from the first rollout slice

## Validation Signals

Use these signals for testing, review, and regression checks. They are not an instruction to include a separate "Validation Signals" section in normal user-facing replies.

- run `artifacts/self_serve_rollout_example.py` against a temporary MotherDuck database
- verify the output names exactly one `first_audience` and one `first_asset`
- verify the first asset is backed by a governed dataset rather than an ad hoc raw table
- treat rollout plans without ownership and sharing boundaries as incomplete

## Language Focus: TypeScript/Javascript and Python

- Prefer **TypeScript/TSX** when the rollout artifact is a Dive, dashboard, or UI-facing analytics surface.
- Prefer **Python** when the rollout artifact is:
  - data curation
  - dataset publishing
  - metric validation
  - onboarding automation
- The usual split is:
  - Python for trusted dataset creation
  - TypeScript/TSX for the user-facing analytical surface

## TypeScript/TSX Starter

```tsx
import { useSQLQuery } from "@motherduck/react-sql-query";
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, ResponsiveContainer } from "recharts";

const N = (v: unknown): number => (v != null ? Number(v) : 0);

export default function TeamKpiView() {
  const kpis = useSQLQuery(`
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS team_count,
           COUNT(*) AS total_accounts,
           ROUND(SUM(arr), 0) AS total_arr
    FROM "analytics"."main"."customer_health"
  `);

  const byTeam = useSQLQuery(`
    SELECT team,
           COUNT(*) AS accounts,
           ROUND(SUM(arr), 0) AS arr
    FROM "analytics"."main"."customer_health"
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY arr DESC
  `);

  const kpiRows = Array.isArray(kpis.data) ? kpis.data : [];
  const teamData = (Array.isArray(byTeam.data) ? byTeam.data : []).map(r => ({
    team: r.team as string,
    arr: N(r.arr),
  }));

  return (
    <div className="p-6" style={{ background: "#f8f8f8" }}>
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold" style={{ color: "#231f20" }}>Team Health</h1>
      <p className="text-sm mb-6" style={{ color: "#6a6a6a" }}>Account and ARR overview by team</p>

      <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-8 mb-8">
        {[
          { label: "Teams", value: kpiRows[0]?.team_count, fmt: (v: number) => String(v) },
          { label: "Accounts", value: kpiRows[0]?.total_accounts, fmt: (v: number) => v.toLocaleString() },
          { label: "Total ARR", value: kpiRows[0]?.total_arr, fmt: (v: number) => `$${(v / 1000).toFixed(0)}K` },
        ].map(({ label, value, fmt }) => (
          <div key={label}>
            {kpis.isLoading ? (
              <div className="h-12 w-24 bg-gray-200 animate-pulse rounded" />
            ) : (
              <p className="text-5xl font-bold" style={{ color: "#231f20" }}>{fmt(N(value))}</p>
            )}
            <p className="text-sm mt-2" style={{ color: "#6a6a6a" }}>{label}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2" style={{ color: "#231f20" }}>ARR by Team</h2>
      {byTeam.isLoading ? (
        <div className="bg-gray-100 animate-pulse rounded" style={{ height: 220 }} />
      ) : (
        <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={220}>
          <BarChart data={teamData}>
            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" stroke="#eee" />
            <XAxis dataKey="team" fontSize={11} />
            <YAxis tickFormatter={(v) => `$${(v / 1000).toFixed(0)}K`} fontSize={11} />
            <Tooltip formatter={(v: number) => `$${v.toLocaleString()}`} />
            <Bar dataKey="arr" fill="#0777b3" radius={[4, 4, 0, 0]} />
          </BarChart>
        </ResponsiveContainer>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Python Dataset Starter

```python
import duckdb

USE_CASE_USER_AGENT = "agent-skills/2.2.2(harness-<harness>;llm-<llm>)"

conn = duckdb.connect(f"md:analytics?custom_user_agent={USE_CASE_USER_AGENT}")
conn.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "analytics"."main"."customer_health" AS
SELECT team, account_id, status, arr
FROM "analytics"."main"."accounts"
WHERE status IS NOT NULL
""")
conn.close()
```

## Public Product Anchors To Use

- Dives are interactive visualizations created on top of live MotherDuck queries.
- Dives persist in the MotherDuck workspace alongside SQL and data.
- MotherDuck positions Dives for the long tail of questions that do not justify a full dashboard, not as a replacement for every BI workflow.
- Dives are shareable and live.
- Read scaling is the official answer when dashboard or BI traffic becomes read-heavy and concurrent.
- Shares are zero-copy, read-only database-level distribution, so publish only curated databases rather than raw internal workspaces.

## What Good Self-Serve Looks Like

- one obvious entry point
- a small number of trusted datasets
- KPI definitions that are stable and documented
- default filters and views that match how the business works
- sharing patterns that do not expose more than intended

## What To Publish First

Start with one of these:

- one curated KPI dashboard in a Dive
- one trusted analytical view for a single department
- one share for a team that already knows how to query

Do not start by exposing raw tables across the whole organization.

## Recommended Sequence

### Step 1: Curate The Data

- use `motherduck-explore` to discover source tables
- use `motherduck-query` to confirm metrics and dimensions
- **check date ranges and row counts** before writing filters -- source tables may not cover the period you expect, and building a rollout on stale or empty data wastes effort
- use `motherduck-model-data` to publish a wide, analytics-ready table or view

A quick data freshness check before curating:

```sql
SELECT min(created_date) AS earliest,
       max(created_date) AS latest,
       count(*) AS total_rows
FROM "analytics"."main"."source_table";
```

If the latest date is older than expected, confirm with the user before proceeding.

### Step 2: Publish The First Asset

- use `motherduck-create-dive` for the first interactive dashboard
- use `motherduck-share-data` when a downstream team needs governed access to the data itself

### Step 2a: Choose Between Dives And Shares

- Use a Dive when:
  - the audience needs a ready-made answer surface
  - filters, drill-downs, and live refresh matter
  - the question is recurring but not important enough for a full BI program
- Use a share when:
  - the consuming team wants direct SQL access
  - the audience is another data team or power users
  - the output should be reusable in another tool or workflow

### Step 3: Expand With Guardrails

- define who owns metric changes
- avoid too many near-duplicate dashboards; flag similarities
- standardize filters, labels, and naming
- expand by use case, not by dumping every table on every team

## Scale Guidance

- If a self-serve rollout becomes read-heavy, add read scaling instead of over-provisioning a single path for everyone.
- If the rollout becomes customer-facing rather than internal, switch to `motherduck-build-cfa-app` patterns instead of stretching a self-serve setup too far.
- If the organization wants a governed catalog of reusable visual assets, lean into Dives plus a small number of curated shares.
- If teams want direct SQL access, publish a clean share boundary and document ownership rather than pointing users at raw staging tables.

## What Not To Promise

- Do not imply Dives replace the team's existing BI tool for every use case.
- Do not imply broad self-serve succeeds without a curated semantic layer or trusted data model.

The output of this skill should be a rollout plan with a first asset, first audience, and clear guardrails.
