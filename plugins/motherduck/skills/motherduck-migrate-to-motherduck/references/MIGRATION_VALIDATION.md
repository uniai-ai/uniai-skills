# Migration Validation Reference

Concrete SQL patterns and a Python orchestrator for validating that a migration to MotherDuck produced correct results. Every query outputs a `pct_variance` column so the user can decide what is acceptable.

## Row Count Comparison

Compare total row counts between source and target with percentage variance.

```sql
WITH counts AS (
    SELECT
        'source' AS side,
        count(*) AS row_count
    FROM "source_db"."main"."orders"
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        'target' AS side,
        count(*) AS row_count
    FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
)
SELECT
    MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'source') AS source_rows,
    MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'target') AS target_rows,
    MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'target')
        - MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'source') AS row_diff,
    ROUND(
        100.0
        * (MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'target')
           - MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'source'))
        / NULLIF(MAX(row_count) FILTER (WHERE side = 'source'), 0),
        2
    ) AS pct_variance
FROM counts;
```

---

## Side-by-Side Metric Comparison

Compare key aggregates between source and target. Replace `amount` and `quantity` with your numeric columns.

```sql
WITH source_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        count(*) AS row_count,
        SUM(amount) AS sum_amount,
        AVG(amount) AS avg_amount,
        MIN(amount) AS min_amount,
        MAX(amount) AS max_amount,
        SUM(quantity) AS sum_quantity,
        AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM "source_db"."main"."orders"
),
target_metrics AS (
    SELECT
        count(*) AS row_count,
        SUM(amount) AS sum_amount,
        AVG(amount) AS avg_amount,
        MIN(amount) AS min_amount,
        MAX(amount) AS max_amount,
        SUM(quantity) AS sum_quantity,
        AVG(quantity) AS avg_quantity
    FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
),
comparisons AS (
    SELECT unnest([
        {'metric': 'row_count',    'source': s.row_count::DOUBLE,    'target': t.row_count::DOUBLE},
        {'metric': 'sum_amount',   'source': s.sum_amount::DOUBLE,   'target': t.sum_amount::DOUBLE},
        {'metric': 'avg_amount',   'source': s.avg_amount::DOUBLE,   'target': t.avg_amount::DOUBLE},
        {'metric': 'min_amount',   'source': s.min_amount::DOUBLE,   'target': t.min_amount::DOUBLE},
        {'metric': 'max_amount',   'source': s.max_amount::DOUBLE,   'target': t.max_amount::DOUBLE},
        {'metric': 'sum_quantity', 'source': s.sum_quantity::DOUBLE, 'target': t.sum_quantity::DOUBLE},
        {'metric': 'avg_quantity', 'source': s.avg_quantity::DOUBLE, 'target': t.avg_quantity::DOUBLE}
    ]) AS r
    FROM source_metrics s, target_metrics t
)
SELECT
    r.metric AS metric_name,
    r.source AS source_value,
    r.target AS target_value,
    ROUND(r.target - r.source, 4) AS abs_diff,
    ROUND(
        100.0 * (r.target - r.source) / NULLIF(r.source, 0), 2
    ) AS pct_variance
FROM comparisons;
```

---

## Uniqueness Check on Target

Verify the migration did not introduce duplicate records. Replace `order_id` with your primary key column.

```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    count(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
```

An empty result set means no duplicates exist.

---

## New Records (In Target, Not In Source)

Identify records that appear in the target but not in the source. These may be expected (if the migration included new data) or a problem.

```sql
SELECT order_id
FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
EXCEPT
SELECT order_id
FROM "source_db"."main"."orders";
```

Count them:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS new_record_count
FROM (
    SELECT order_id FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
    EXCEPT
    SELECT order_id FROM "source_db"."main"."orders"
);
```

---

## Deleted Records (In Source, Not In Target)

Identify records that exist in the source but are missing from the target.

```sql
SELECT order_id
FROM "source_db"."main"."orders"
EXCEPT
SELECT order_id
FROM "target_db"."main"."orders";
```

Count them:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS deleted_record_count
FROM (
    SELECT order_id FROM "source_db"."main"."orders"
    EXCEPT
    SELECT order_id FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
);
```

---

## Changed Records Tracking

Find records that exist in both source and target but have different values. Replace column names with your own.

### Column-Level Comparison

Use `IS DISTINCT FROM` instead of `<>` to handle NULLs correctly.

```sql
SELECT
    s.order_id,
    s.amount AS source_amount,
    t.amount AS target_amount,
    s.status AS source_status,
    t.status AS target_status
FROM "source_db"."main"."orders" s
JOIN "target_db"."main"."orders" t
    ON s.order_id = t.order_id
WHERE s.amount IS DISTINCT FROM t.amount
   OR s.status IS DISTINCT FROM t.status;
```

### Hash-Based Comparison for Wide Tables

When a table has many columns, compare row hashes instead of listing every column.

```sql
WITH source_hashed AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        md5(COLUMNS(* EXCLUDE (order_id))::VARCHAR) AS row_hash
    FROM "source_db"."main"."orders"
),
target_hashed AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        md5(COLUMNS(* EXCLUDE (order_id))::VARCHAR) AS row_hash
    FROM "target_db"."main"."orders"
)
SELECT
    COALESCE(s.order_id, t.order_id) AS order_id,
    s.row_hash AS source_hash,
    t.row_hash AS target_hash
FROM source_hashed s
JOIN target_hashed t
    ON s.order_id = t.order_id
WHERE s.row_hash IS DISTINCT FROM t.row_hash;
```

Once you identify changed IDs via hashing, use the column-level comparison query filtered to those IDs to see exactly what changed.

### Performance Note

For large tables, filter both sides to a date range or partition before comparing:

```sql
-- Add a WHERE clause to both source and target CTEs
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date < '2024-02-01'
```

## Investigating Non-Zero Variance

When validation reports non-zero variance, do not treat it as an automatic failure. Investigate in order:

1. **Row count differs?** Check for new or deleted records first. Use the EXCEPT queries above to find exactly which keys are affected. New records may be expected if the migration included a data refresh.

2. **Aggregates differ but row count matches?** Run the column-level comparison to find changed rows. Common causes:
   - floating-point rounding differences between source and DuckDB (usually < 0.01%)
   - timezone handling differences on timestamps that affect date-based aggregations
   - NULL handling differences (`NULL + 5` returns `NULL` in DuckDB, some sources treat it as `5`)

3. **Small variance (< 0.5%)?** Document it and decide with the user whether it is acceptable. Many migrations accept small rounding variance on financial aggregates.

4. **Large variance (> 1%)?** Narrow it down to specific rows. Filter the metric comparison to date ranges, customer segments, or product categories to isolate the affected partition. The usual suspects are:
   - duplicate rows in either source or target
   - a WHERE clause in the migration that excluded records
   - type coercion that changed values (e.g., truncating DECIMAL precision)

5. **Hash comparison finds changed rows?** Use the column-level comparison filtered to those keys to see exactly which columns changed. This is the fastest path to root cause.

### Usage Example

```python
import duckdb

# Connect to both databases
USE_CASE_USER_AGENT = "agent-skills/2.2.2(harness-<harness>;llm-<llm>)"
conn = duckdb.connect(f"md:?custom_user_agent={USE_CASE_USER_AGENT}")

# If source is a Postgres database (local DuckDB only):
# conn.sql("ATTACH 'dbname=legacy host=pg.example.com' AS source_db (TYPE POSTGRES, READ_ONLY)")

results = validate_migration(
    source_conn=conn,
    target_conn=conn,
    source_table='"source_db"."main"."orders"',
    target_table='"target_db"."main"."orders"',
    key_column="order_id",
    numeric_columns=["amount", "quantity"],
    variance_threshold_pct=0.5,  # allow 0.5% variance
)

print_report(results)
```
