# Build a Customer-Facing Analytics App

Use this skill when the user is embedding analytics into a product for external users and needs a concrete serving architecture, not just a dashboard.

This is a use-case skill. It orchestrates `motherduck-connect`, `motherduck-explore`, `motherduck-model-data`, `motherduck-query`, and `motherduck-load-data`.

## Start Here: Is a MotherDuck Server Active?

Always determine this first.

- If a **remote MotherDuck MCP server** or **local MotherDuck server** is active, use it.
- If the user has not said which database backs the project, ask for the target database or workspace before designing the app.
- Then inspect the live data model:
  - databases and schemas
  - tables and views
  - columns and types
  - join keys
  - time dimensions
  - core serving metrics
- Use that discovery to shape the serving pattern, tenant boundaries, and example code.

Do not jump straight to an architecture diagram if live data discovery is available.

If no server is active, ask for a representative schema excerpt or table list and keep assumptions explicit.

## Use This Skill When

- The user needs embedded or product-facing analytics.
- Tenant isolation or blast radius matters.
- Read concurrency and latency matter.
- The project needs a backend contract, not just a Dive.
- The requirement is stronger than an internal dashboard or a read-only embed.

## Default Serving Choices

- **3-tier CFA** is the default:
  - browser -> backend API -> MotherDuck
- Keep customer routing, connection selection, service-account usage, and embed-session creation on the backend.
- **Embedded Dives** are acceptable when:
  - the requirement is read-only
  - the product needs a live Dive surface shipped into an app
  - app-side policy and UX control are limited
  - a backend can create embed sessions and keep admin tokens server-side
- **DuckDB-Wasm** is acceptable only for small, browser-side, read-only workloads.
- **Single shared tenant_id filtering** is the fallback, not the recommendation.

## Workflow

1. Confirm whether live MotherDuck discovery is available.
2. Explore the actual data model that will back the app.
3. Choose the serving pattern:
   - 3-tier app
   - embedded Dive
   - browser-only prototype
4. Design the isolation model:
   - per customer database
   - per workload or service-account boundary
5. Define the API contract with allowlisted metrics, dimensions, filters, and customer boundaries.
6. Choose the connection path and read-scaling posture.
7. Produce the implementation plan, API contract, and rollout sequence.

When this skill produces a native DuckDB (`md:`) connection, watermark it with `custom_user_agent=agent-skills/2.2.2(harness-<harness>;llm-<llm>)`. If metadata is missing, fall back to `harness-unknown` and `llm-unknown`.

## Output

The output of this skill should be:

- a recommended serving architecture
- the isolation model
- the connection strategy
- the first implementation slice
- the validation and rollout plan

If the caller explicitly asks for structured JSON, return raw JSON only with no Markdown fences or prose before/after it.
This is mainly for automated tests, regression checks, or downstream tooling that needs a stable machine-readable shape. Normal human-facing use of the skill can stay in prose unless JSON is explicitly requested.

Use this exact top-level shape when JSON is requested:

```json
{
  "summary": {},
  "assumptions": [],
  "implementation_plan": [],
  "validation_plan": [],
  "risks": []
}
```
