- **Contract type** (e.g. SaaS agreement, employment contract, NDA, supplier contract)

WARNING: This review is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Always consult a qualified solicitor or lawyer before signing any legally binding agreement.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Overall risk rating is justified (not just "Medium" without reasons)
- [ ] All flagged clauses have a specific recommended action (not just "read this")
- [ ] Missing clauses section is completed for this contract type
- [ ] Plain English summary can be understood by a non-lawyer
- [ ] Disclaimer is included

## Anti-Patterns

- [ ] Do not provide legal advice or suggest the review substitutes for qualified legal counsel
- [ ] Do not skip flagging unusual or one-sided clauses because they appear standard
- [ ] Do not omit a plain-English summary — legal jargon alone is not useful output
- [ ] Do not rate risk without explaining what specifically drives that rating
- [ ] Do not ignore missing clauses — absence of key protections is itself a risk

## Example Trigger Phrases
- "Review this contract: [paste]"
- "Flag the key risks in this agreement"
- "Summarise this SaaS contract in plain English"
- "What should I watch out for in this supplier agreement?"
